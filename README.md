Hello World! This is my first github project, so I apologize in advance if I have done anything different that expected.

Running this Python code pulls a csv file from this website: https://covidtracking.com/api/v1/states/daily.csv. This website updates their data once per day. Running this code on Google Colaboratory took ~ 1 minute, 15 seconds from initilization to finished plots

-- Update 2021.05.20 --
API used does not work anymore
